Developmental Models:

Android is developed using an open-source model.
Google leads the development of the Android operating system, but it involves contributions from the open-source community.
The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is where the core Android codebase is maintained and made available to the public.



Licensing:

Android uses the Apache License for its open-source components, which allows for the free use, modification, and distribution of the software.
However, Google Mobile Services (GMS), a set of proprietary Google apps and services that often come pre-installed on Android devices, is subject to a separate licensing agreement with Google.
Mode of 


Funding:

Google funds the development of Android primarily as an investment in its ecosystem. They earn revenue through services, advertising, and app sales on the Android platform.
The open-source nature of Android also allows other organizations and developers to contribute to its development.



Commercial/Non-Commercial Use:

Android is used both commercially and non-commercially.
Commercially, many smartphone manufacturers use Android as the operating system for their devices. They may also customize it with their own user interfaces and apps.
Non-commercially, Android is used in various community-driven projects, such as custom ROMs, and by hobbyists for personal projects.
